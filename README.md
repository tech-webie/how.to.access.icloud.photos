As long as you have iCloud Photo Library turned on on your phone, then the pictures you see in the Photos app are your iCloud photos.  It's that simple. However, if you have Optimize Storage turned on, then the photos on your iPhone are just compressed, lower-resolution versions. The full versions are stored in iCloud. You can check if this setting is turned on by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Photos.


## Access iCloud photos in the Photos app
As long as both your Mac and your iPhone are signed in to the same iCloud account, then similarly to the Photos app on your iPhone, youâ€™ll be able to view your iCloud pictures from the Photos app on your Mac.

* Open the Photos app.
* Tap the Photos tab.
* Another way to access your iCloud photos on all your devices is My Photo Stream, but that feature also shows you the most recent photos. Check out our guide to using My Photo Stream on iPhone and Mac.
